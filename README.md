# Neighbourhood Map React

This project is part od the Udacity FEND Nanodegree. **Neighbourhood Map React** is a single page app presenting certain places in the neighbourhood. In this case - in Warsaw, Poland. The app is based na a React framework and uses Google Maps and Foursquare - for location-based services. Using Foursquare wasn't a must in this project, however I wanted to demonstrate usage of different services APIs in one app and how they work together.


## How to run the project

You need node.js server installed in order to run the app on your computer.

1. In the directory containing this cloned project, run `npm install`, then simply run `npm start`. This will start the app in your browser, showing https://localhost:3000 in the address field.

*IMPORTANT* The service worker with the create-react-app only works in the production build. To run the app in production, use the command `npm run serve`. Then visit https://localhost:5000 in your browser.

**Neighbourhood Map React** lets the user choose from the list of given places. Typing in the search box filters presented locations. The user may also click on any marker. It will result with displaying info location details.
