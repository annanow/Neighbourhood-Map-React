# Neighbourhood Map React

This project is part od the Udacity FEND Nanodegree. **Neighbourhood Map React** is a single page app presenting certain places in the neighbourhood. In this case - in Warsaw, Poland. The app is based na a React framework and uses Google Maps and Foursquare - for location-based services. Using Foursquare wasn't a must in this project, however I wanted to demonstrate usage of different services APIs in one app and how they work together.


## How to run the project

You need node.js server installed in order to run the app on your computer.

*IMPORTANT* The service worker with the create-react-app only works in the production build. To run the app in production, use the command `npm run build` and run `serve -s build` in the directory containing this cloned project. Then visit https://localhost:5000 in your browser.

## How to use the app

**Neighbourhood Map React** lets the user choose from the list of given places. Typing in the search box filters presented locations. The user may also click on any marker. It will result with displaying info location details.
